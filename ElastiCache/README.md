# ElastiCache Lens for Well-Architected

The well-architected lens for ElastiCache will help users understand and implement best practices when using ElastiCache. The lens will provide guidance on how to design and operate highly available and scalable ElastiCache clusters.

ElastiCache is a popular in-memory caching service that enables users to improve the performance of their applications by caching frequently accessed data in memory. However, designing and operating highly available and scalable ElastiCache clusters can be challenging, especially for users who are new to the service or lack expertise in distributed systems.
This lens covers five pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability (is to be updated)

## Benefits:
The well-architected lens for ElastiCache will provide the following benefits:

* Help users design and operate highly available and scalable ElastiCache clusters.
* Provide best practices for securing ElastiCache clusters and protecting sensitive data.
* Explain how to monitor and troubleshoot ElastiCache clusters to identify and resolve issues quickly.
* Improve the reliability and performance of applications that use ElastiCache.
