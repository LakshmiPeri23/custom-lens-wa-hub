# AWS Well-Architected Container Build Lens

The AWS Well-Architected Container Build Lens will focus specifically on the container design and build process.

This lens covers six pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability. 

Building containerized applications brings a new dimension of considerations to each of these pillars. The architecture of containerized applications requires you to reconsider how to address security, operational efficiency, stability, and agility of their application stack when compared with traditional applications.
