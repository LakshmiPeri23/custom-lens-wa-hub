# AWS Passport Well-Architected Custom Lens

AWS Passport is a program designed to help software companies grow their businesses internationally and lower the risks of global expansion (e.g. operational challenges, cultural adaptation, slow market entry, and failure to realize growth). Software Companies selected into the AWS Passport program will receive guided access to AWS resources/programs and partners to help address strategic planning, operational, technical, and go-to-market challenges.

AWS Passport Well-Architected Custom Lens specifies best practices to reduce risks associated with expansion to new regions. This custom lens is intended to be supplemental to the AWS Well Architected Framework. It is recommended that a Well Architected Framework Review be conducted across all pillars before employing this custom lens. The pillars include:
* Operational excellence
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance efficiency
* Cost optimization
* Sustainability 

The custom lens surfaces risks associated with:
* Technical Debt
* Mutable Infrastructure
* Region Feature Parity
* Region Capacity
* Cold Start Costs
