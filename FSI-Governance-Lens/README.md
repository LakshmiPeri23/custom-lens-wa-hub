# AWS Well-Architected Custom Lens for Regulated Organisations

Enterprise Cloud Governance for APRA, MAS, HKMA, PRA.

The FSI Enterprise Governance Lens for Regulated Organisations is designed to assist customers
assessing their compliance with regulatory principles across APRA, RBMZ, MAS, HKMA and PRA.

While not a replacement for a formal engagement, this Lens provides directional guidance
to help customers understand their compliance obligations. Principles-based regulators require 
diligence to ensure that a sufficient amount of detail is included, and that new or
 emerging challenges are understood and handled.

After completing the custom lens, you will have a good sense for the key gaps in your compliance across the following five areas:

1. Foundational
2. Capability
3. Risk
4. Business Continuity
5. Communications

## Intended Audience

Technology roles, such as chief technology officers (CTOs), architects, developers, engineers, and operations team members, as well as individuals in risk, compliance, and audit functions.
